        <h1>Dark Web 101</h1>
        <p>The dark web is a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines. It consists of hidden websites that require special tools to access.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Access the Dark Web?</h2>
        <p>To access the dark web, you need a special browser like Tor. Tor allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their connections through a series of nodes, making it difficult to trace their activities.</p>
        
        <h2>What Can You Find on the Dark Web?</h2>
        <p>The dark web hosts a wide range of content, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marketplaces for illegal drugs, firearms, counterfeit goods, and stolen data</li>
            <li>Forums and communities for discussing various topics, including hacking, privacy, politics, and conspiracy theories</li>
            <li>Whistleblower platforms for anonymously sharing sensitive information</li>
            <li>File-sharing services for distributing pirated software, movies, music, and leaked documents</li>
            <li>Platforms for hiring hackers, hitmen, and other illegal services</li>
            <li>Red rooms (though often considered a myth)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Risks and Dangers</h2>
        <p>While there are legitimate uses for the dark web, it's important to be aware of the risks and dangers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encountering illegal and disturbing content</li>
            <li>Exposing oneself to scams and fraud</li>
            <li>Becoming a victim of hacking or malware</li>
            <li>Legal consequences for accessing or participating in illegal activities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Staying Safe on the Dark Web</h2>
        <p>If you choose to explore the dark web, it's essential to take precautions to protect your identity and personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a secure browser like Tor and keep it updated</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files</li>
            <li>Never provide personal information or login credentials on dark web websites</li>
            <li>Consider using a VPN for an additional layer of security</li>
            <li>Be cautious when interacting with others on the dark web and assume that not everyone has good intentions</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="content" id="tor" style="display: none;">
        <h1>Tor 101</h1>
        <p>Tor is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. It is designed to protect users' privacy and freedom online by routing their internet traffic through a worldwide network of volunteer-run servers called nodes.</p>
        
        <h2>How Does Tor Work?</h2>
        <p>When you use Tor, your internet traffic is encrypted and then routed through a random series of Tor nodes before reaching its destination. This process helps to hide your IP address and browsing activity from anyone monitoring the network.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Use Tor?</h2>
        <p>There are several reasons why people use Tor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protecting privacy and anonymity online</li>
            <li>Bypassing internet censorship and surveillance</li>
            <li>Accessing blocked websites and services</li>
            <li>Contributing to the Tor network by running a node</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Learn More About Tor</h2>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>1. What is the difference between the deep web and the dark web?</h2>
        <p>The deep web refers to any part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines and includes things like private databases, password-protected websites, and unlinked content. The dark web is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and often associated with illegal activities.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Is it illegal to access the dark web?</h2>
        <p>No, it is not illegal to access the dark web itself. However, many illegal activities take place on the dark web, so accessing certain content or participating in illegal activities can be illegal and may have legal consequences.</p>
        
        <h2>3. How can I stay anonymous on the dark web?</h2>
        <p>Using a secure browser like Tor, along with other privacy tools like VPNs and encrypted messaging apps, can help you stay anonymous on the dark web. However, it's important to remember that no method of staying anonymous is foolproof, and there are always risks involved.</p>
